# Todo-list
This is my first javascript project, i am excited at the final outcome, the joy of thinking a programme through and executing it in code.

What are the things i learned with this project?.
1. I had my first introduction to the Dom, referencing a tag and class element using javascript, writing callback functions, 
2. Writing array filters and cycling through arrays with forEach,
3. Learning how the setInterval work and the setTimeout.

Looking forward to more javascript and react programs as learning progresses.
Thank you.
